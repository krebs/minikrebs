Purpose
-------

The purpose of this trait is to connect an Arduino to the network so that it can be flashed and the console can be interacted with over the network using the Arduino IDE.

Hardware
--------

The following hardware is the currently known minimum requirement:
- TP-LINK TP-710n, approximately 20 EUR shipped (8 MB flash)
- Arduino Uno, Mega, or Leonardo

Operation
---------

TODO
